# Beyond the Leaf: Intelligent Lightweight Disease Detection in Tea Plants with Spatial Convolutional Neural Networks and Explainable AI


#### Features: 
- Lightweight Model: Utilizes a compact CNN model with around 1.7 milion parameters. 
- The model has been trained on a largest dataset of 7,867images of six types of classes of Tea leaf.  
- Outperforms standard models, including VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and Xception, in certain metrics.
- Includes accuracy graph, loss graph, ROC curve, classification report, and PR curve to illustrate model performance. 
- Provides the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), GFLOPs and Inference time for model reliability assessment. 
- Disease classification is enhanced with Grad-CAM for visual insight into the modelâ€™s focus areas, making it easier to understand how the model detects disease patterns. 
- Deployment of the model as a mobile app for real world use.
